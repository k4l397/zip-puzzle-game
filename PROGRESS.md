- Algorithm optimization (dependent on puzzle generation)

## Next Steps
1. **PRIMARY GOAL**: Implement Phase 3 - Puzzle Generation Algorithm
2. Create Hamiltonian path generator using backtracking DFS
3. Add dynamic dot placement for unlimited unique puzzles

## Key Achievements
- **Fixed critical rendering bug** - Grid now displays properly
- **Enhanced game rules** - Must end on final dot for authentic LinkedIn Zip experience
- **Comprehensive testing** - Playwright test suite prevents regressions
- **Continuous pipe visualization** - Looks like actual connected pipes, not numbered cells
- **Cross-platform support** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Professional UI/UX** - Polished design with smooth animations

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented comprehensive Playwright testing for regression prevention
- Fixed pipe visualization to match LinkedIn Zip aesthetic (continuous pipes, not numbered cells)
- Enhanced win condition to require ending on final numbered dot
- Created game logic utilities for better code organization
- Prioritized stability and user experience over additional features

## Technical Debt / Issues
- **Primary remaining work**: Replace hardcoded puzzles with dynamic generation algorithm
- Should consolidate Position interface into shared types (low priority)
- Could add more advanced difficulty options (future enhancement)

## Notes
Game has exceeded initial scope with comprehensive testing, bug fixes, and enhanced gameplay mechanics. Ready for puzzle generation algorithm implementation to complete the core experience.
