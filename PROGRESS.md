## Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Grid System
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Dynamic n√ón grid rendering
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Cell state management (empty, occupied, pipe segment)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Grid coordinate system and navigation

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  
**Notes:** Grid system fully functional with dynamic sizing, proper cell state tracking, and coordinate management.

### 2.2 Drawing Interface
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Mouse drag functionality for desktop
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Touch drag support for mobile
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Pipe path visualization
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Path validation (orthogonal movement only)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Drag-back functionality to reverse paths

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  
**Notes:** Full drawing interface implemented with mouse and touch support. Path validation ensures orthogonal movement and allows path reversal by dragging backwards.

### 2.3 Game State Management
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Track current path state
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Validate dot connection order (1‚Üí2‚Üí3...)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Win condition detection (all cells filled + correct path)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Game reset functionality

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  
**Notes:** Complete game state management with path tracking, dot order validation, and proper win condition detection. Game resets properly when starting new puzzles.

## Current Blockers
None

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3.1 - Implement puzzle generation algorithm
2. Create Hamiltonian path generator using backtracking DFS
3. Add proper dot placement strategy for solvable puzzles

## Key Decisions Made
- Used individual Position interfaces in components instead of shared types to avoid module resolution issues
- Fixed TypeScript timer type to use `number` instead of `NodeJS.Timeout`
- Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Created comprehensive drawing interface supporting both mouse and touch
- Added visual feedback for path progression (start/end cells, path numbering, next dot highlighting)
- Implemented game logic utilities for better code organization

## Technical Debt / Issues
- Need to implement Generator component (Phase 3 priority)
- Should consolidate Position interface into shared types later
- Sample puzzles are hardcoded - need proper generation algorithm
- Could optimize path validation performance for larger grids
