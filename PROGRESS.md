### Phase 2: Basic Game Structure  
- [x] Game Component (with UI, state management, controls)
- [x] Timer Component (stopwatch functionality)
- [x] Grid Component (Canvas rendering, touch/mouse input)
- [x] Cell Component Logic (integrated in Grid)

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics
- [x] Dot Component (integrated in Grid)
- [x] Pipe System (canvas-based path drawing)
- [x] Input Handling (mouse + touch with drag/undo)

### Phase 4: Puzzle Generation
- [x] Puzzle Generator Component (backtracking DFS algorithm)
- [x] Validation System (PathValidator with comprehensive checks)
- [x] Random Generation (Hamiltonian path with fallback)

### Phase 5: User Experience

- [x] Game State Management (win detection, mode switching)
- [x] UI/UX Polish (responsive design, accessibility)

### Phase 6: Cross-Platform
- [x] Desktop Support (mouse interactions, hover states)
- [x] Mobile Support (touch events, responsive layout)
- [x] Browser Compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Phase 7: Testing
- [x] Unit Tests (puzzle generation, path validation)
- [x] Integration Tests (Playwright E2E testing)
- [x] Manual Testing (cross-browser, mobile devices)

### Phase 8: Production
- [x] Performance Optimization (Canvas API, high DPI, 60fps)
- [x] Local Storage Integration (grid size preferences)
- [x] Production Deployment (build system ready)

### Phase 9: Completion
- [x] Code Quality (ESLint passing, TypeScript strict mode)
- [x] Documentation (comprehensive code comments, README ready)
